## [Merge sort](./4_mergeSortReport.md)
- Show how many array access are in Mergesort- Merge
- Write your own merge sort algorithm in bottom-up approach, and  describe in detail of yours 



## [Quick sort](./5_quick_sort_report.md)

- suppose we implement QuickSort so that ChoosePivot always selects the "first element" of the array. What is the running time of this algorithm on an input array that is already sorted?
- Suppose we run QuickSort on some input, and magically, every recursive all chooses the "median" element of its subarray as its pivot. What's the running time in this case?
- If T(n) = T(n/3) + T(2n/3) + n, express T(n) in big-O
- Implement 3-way partition quick sort
